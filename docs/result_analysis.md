## 7. Integration Recommendations

### Primary Algorithm Selection
1. **Primary recommendation**: **Prioritize QQN variants** based on statistical dominance evidence (14-17 wins vs 4-12 losses against non-QQN methods)
2. **Convex/Well-conditioned problems**: **QQN-Backtracking or QQN-StrongWolfe** (statistical superiority + efficiency)
3. **Multimodal optimization**: **QQN-Bisection-2** (17W-6L-6T record + 85% success on StyblinskiTang_2D)
4. **Neural network training**: **QQN variants with Adam-Fast fallback** (leverage statistical dominance while maintaining specialization)
5. **SVM/Classification**: **QQN-GoldenSection with GD-WeightDecay fallback** for specialized performance

### Problem-Specific Triggers
- **Any problem type**: **Start with QQN variants** (statistical evidence of superiority)
- **Dimension â‰¤ 5 + Convex**: **QQN-Backtracking** (16W-4L-9T + efficiency)
- **Dimension > 5 + Multimodal**: **QQN-Bisection-2** (17W-6L-6T + strong multimodal performance)
- **Known smooth landscape**: **QQN-StrongWolfe** (16W-6L-7T record)
- **Highly constrained/regularized**: **QQN-GoldenSection** (14W-5L-10T + specialized performance)

### Decision Criteria
- **Statistical reliability priority**: **Use QQN variants** (consistent 14-17 wins vs 4-12 losses)
- **Function evaluation budget < 50**: **QQN-Backtracking** (25-83 evaluations + statistical dominance)
- **Dimensionality > 10**: **QQN-Bisection-2** (best statistical record + scalability)
- **Unknown problem structure**: **QQN-Bisection-2** (17W-6L-6T record + broad applicability)

### Fallback Strategy
Implement a **QQN-first cascading approach**: Begin with **QQN-Bisection-2** (strongest statistical record), fall back to **QQN-Backtracking** for efficiency needs, and use specialized non-QQN methods only for domain-specific requirements where statistical evidence supports their use.
