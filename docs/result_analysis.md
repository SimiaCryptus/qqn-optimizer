## 6. Key Performance Patterns

### Pattern 1: Problem-Specific Algorithm Superiority
**L-BFGS variants dominate convex problems** while **Adam-Fast excels on multimodal landscapes**. No single algorithm performs consistently across all problem types.

### Pattern 2: Scalability Challenges
**Universal performance degradation with dimensionality increase**. Success rates drop 50-90% when moving from 2D to 10D across all algorithm families.

### Pattern 3: Line Search Impact
**QQN line search variants show dramatic performance differences**: QQN-GoldenSection requires 355-913 function evaluations while QQN-Backtracking needs only 25-83 evaluations for similar success rates.

### Pattern 4: ML Problem Specialization
**Adam variants consistently outperform on neural networks** while **classical methods excel on regression problems**. GD-WeightDecay achieves 100% success on SVM vs 0% for most other methods.

### Pattern 5: Robustness vs Efficiency Trade-off
**Conservative methods (L-BFGS-Conservative) show poor performance** with 5% success rates, while **aggressive variants achieve 100% success** but may be less stable.

## 7. Integration Recommendations

### Primary Algorithm Selection
1. **Convex/Well-conditioned problems**: Use L-BFGS-Aggressive (100% success, 7-10 evaluations)
2. **Multimodal optimization**: Deploy Adam-Fast (40-65% success rates across problem types)
3. **Neural network training**: Prioritize Adam-Fast (35-45% success vs 0% for most others)
4. **SVM/Classification**: Use GD-WeightDecay (100% success on tested problems)

### Problem-Specific Triggers
- **Dimension â‰¤ 5 + Convex**: L-BFGS-Aggressive
- **Dimension > 5 + Multimodal**: Adam-Fast
- **Known smooth landscape**: QQN-StrongWolfe or QQN-Backtracking
- **Highly constrained/regularized**: GD-WeightDecay

### Decision Criteria
- **Success rate > 80% required**: Use L-BFGS-Aggressive for convex problems only
- **Function evaluation budget < 50**: Avoid QQN-GoldenSection (300+ evaluations typical)
- **Dimensionality > 10**: Expect significant performance degradation across all methods
- **Unknown problem structure**: Start with Adam-Fast for broad applicability

### Fallback Strategy
Implement a **cascading approach**: Begin with L-BFGS-Aggressive, fall back to Adam-Fast if convergence stalls, and use GD-WeightDecay for final refinement on classification problems.
