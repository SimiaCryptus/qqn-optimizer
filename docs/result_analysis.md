## 4. Scalability Assessment

### Dimension Scaling Analysis

**Algorithms that scale well:**
- L-BFGS variants: Maintain efficiency with dimension
- QQN-Bisection variants: Show linear scaling in function evaluations

**Algorithms with poor scaling:**
- GD variants: Exponential increase in iterations with dimension
- Adam variants: Performance degrades significantly on high-dimensional classical problems

### Specific Examples:
