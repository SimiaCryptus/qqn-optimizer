## 7. Integration Recommendations

### Primary Algorithm Selection

1. **Default Choice**: QQN-StrongWolfe
    - Highest overall success rate
    - Robust across problem types
    - Efficient on smooth landscapes

2. **Fallback Sequence**:
    - First: QQN-CubicQuadraticInterpolation (for faster convergence)
    - Second: L-BFGS-Conservative (for robustness)
    - Third: Adam (for multi-modal problems)

### Problem-Specific Triggers

**Use QQN-GoldenSection when**:
- Objective has multiple local minima with smooth basins
- Problem exhibits symmetry (StyblinskiTang-like)
- Function evaluations are expensive

**Use L-BFGS-MoreThuente when**:
- Problem is known to be convex
- High accuracy required (achieved "0.00e0" on Sphere)
- Dimension < 100

**Use Adam variants when**:
- Landscape is highly multi-modal (Michalewicz-like)
- Gradient noise is present
- Success rate more important than efficiency

**Use QQN-Bisection variants when**:
- Problem has exponential/logarithmic components (Ackley)
- Moderate dimension (5-20)
- Line search stability is critical

### Decision Criteria

1. **Dimension < 10 & Smooth**: L-BFGS-Aggressive
2. **Dimension 10-50 & Non-convex**: QQN-StrongWolfe
3. **Dimension > 50 & Noisy**: Adam-WeightDecay
4. **Multi-modal**: Adam → QQN-CubicQuadraticInterpolation
5. **Ill-conditioned**: QQN-Bisection-1
6. **Unknown characteristics**: QQN-StrongWolfe → L-BFGS-Conservative → Adam

### Implementation Priority

1. **Essential**: QQN-StrongWolfe, L-BFGS-Conservative, Adam
2. **Recommended**: QQN-CubicQuadraticInterpolation, QQN-GoldenSection, L-BFGS-MoreThuente
3. **Specialized**: QQN-Bisection variants, Adam-Fast, GD-AdaptiveMomentum
