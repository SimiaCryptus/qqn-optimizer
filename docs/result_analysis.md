## 4. Scalability Assessment

### Dimension Scaling Impact
- **Rosenbrock performance degradation**:
    - 2D: 50% best success rate
    - 5D: 40% best success rate (20% degradation)
    - 10D: 40% best success rate (maintained by Adam only)

- **Michalewicz scaling**:
    - 2D: 50% best success
    - 5D: 20% best success (60% degradation)
    - 10D: 0% success for all algorithms (100% degradation)

- **Rastrigin scaling**:
    - 2D: 20% best success
    - 5D: 60% best success (actually improved)
    - 10D: 0% success (complete failure)

### Evaluation Cost Scaling
- Function evaluations typically increase 2-3x per 5D increase
- Example: QQN-StrongWolfe on Sphere: 11.0 (2D) → 11.0 (10D) - remarkably stable
- Counter-example: Adam on Rosenbrock: 125.4 (2D) → 584.6 (10D) - 4.7x increase

## 5. Success Rate vs. Efficiency Trade-offs

### High Success, Low Efficiency
- **QQN-GoldenSection on Beale_2D**: 100% success with 440.4 evaluations
- **Adam on Rosenbrock_10D**: 40% success (best) but needs 793.5 evaluations

### High Efficiency, Moderate Success
- **L-BFGS-Aggressive on Sphere_2D**: 100% success with only 9.0 evaluations
- **QQN-Backtracking on Rosenbrock_2D**: 50% success with 195.2 evaluations

### Balanced Performance
- **QQN-StrongWolfe on Michalewicz_2D**: 50% success with 34.4 evaluations
- **L-BFGS on Ackley_2D**: 70% success with 51.0 evaluations

## 6. Key Performance Patterns

### Pattern 1: Algorithm Specialization
- **L-BFGS variants excel on smooth problems** but fail catastrophically on highly non-convex landscapes
- **Adam shows unique robustness** on high-dimensional non-convex problems (only algorithm with success on Rosenbrock_10D)
- **QQN-StrongWolfe provides best general-purpose performance** across problem types

### Pattern 2: Dimension Curse
- **Multimodal problems become intractable** above 5D for all algorithms
- **ML problems remain tractable** even at higher dimensions (93D, 325D neural networks)
- Success rates drop 50-100% when scaling from 2D to 10D on non-convex problems

### Pattern 3: Line Search Impact
- **Aggressive line search (L-BFGS-Aggressive) risks numerical instability** but can dramatically reduce evaluations
- **Conservative approaches (GoldenSection, Bisection) ensure stability** but at 2-5x computational cost
- **Adaptive methods (StrongWolfe, MoreThuente) provide best balance**

### Pattern 4: Problem-Specific Winners
- **Convex**: L-BFGS-Aggressive (9-12 evaluations)
- **Low-dim non-convex**: QQN-StrongWolfe, QQN-Backtracking (50% success)
- **High-dim non-convex**: Adam (only successful algorithm)
- **ML problems**: L-BFGS, QQN variants (45-85 evaluations)

### Pattern 5: Consistent Failure Modes
- **All algorithms fail on 10D multimodal problems** (0% success)
- **Adam-Fast consistently underperforms** standard Adam
- **L-BFGS-Aggressive shows numerical instability** on ill-conditioned problems

## 7. Integration Recommendations

### Primary Algorithm Selection Criteria

**For Convex/Smooth Problems:**
- **First choice**: L-BFGS with standard line search
- **If efficiency critical**: L-BFGS-Aggressive (monitor for instability)
- **Decision threshold**: If condition number < 1000, use aggressive variant

**For Non-Convex Problems (Low Dimension, D ≤ 5):**
- **First choice**: QQN-StrongWolfe
- **Backup**: QQN-Backtracking
- **Decision threshold**: If D ≤ 5 and moderate non-convexity

**For Non-Convex Problems (High Dimension, D > 5):**
- **First choice**: Adam (standard)
- **Backup**: QQN-MoreThuente
- **Decision threshold**: If D > 5 or severe non-convexity detected

**For Multimodal Problems:**
- **D ≤ 2**: L-BFGS or QQN-StrongWolfe
- **2 < D ≤ 5**: Adam with multiple restarts
- **D > 5**: Consider alternative global optimization methods

**For ML Problems:**
- **First choice**: L-BFGS (fastest convergence)
- **Large-scale**: QQN-MoreThuente (memory efficient)
- **Noisy gradients**: Adam (robust to noise)

### Adaptive Strategy Pipeline

1. **Initial probe**: Run L-BFGS for 20 iterations
2. **If converging**: Continue with L-BFGS
3. **If stagnant**: Switch to QQN-StrongWolfe
4. **If oscillating**: Switch to Adam
5. **Fallback**: Multi-start with different algorithms

### Problem Characteristic Triggers

- **Use L-BFGS when**: Gradient norm decreases monotonically
- **Switch to QQN when**: Line search failures > 3 consecutive
- **Switch to Adam when**: Function evaluations > 200 without 50% reduction
- **Restart when**: No improvement for D×10 iterations
