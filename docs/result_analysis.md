## 6. Key Performance Patterns

### Pattern 1: QQN Excels on Well-Conditioned Problems
QQN variants achieved 100% success rates on convex problems (Sphere, Matyas, Levy) with minimal function evaluations (12-50 range).

### Pattern 2: Adam Dominates Complex Landscapes
Adam-Fast consistently outperformed on highly multimodal problems (Michalewicz functions) and neural network optimization.

### Pattern 3: Problem-Specific Specialization
- Rosenbrock functions favored classical GD methods
- Ackley functions preferred L-BFGS variants
- Barrier problems showed universal poor performance (0% success across all methods)

### Pattern 4: Scalability Varies by Algorithm Class
QQN methods maintained efficiency across dimensions, while GD methods showed consistent computational overhead regardless of problem size.

### Pattern 5: Success Rate Clustering
Clear performance tiers emerged: QQN/L-BFGS (top tier), Adam variants (middle tier), standard GD (lower tier).

## 7. Integration Recommendations

### Primary Algorithm Selection
1. **Default choice**: QQN-Bisection-1 for general optimization (won 8/59 problems, consistent performance)
2. **Convex problems**: QQN-GoldenSection (100% success on well-conditioned problems)
3. **Multimodal problems**: Adam-Fast (45-60% success on complex landscapes)
4. **Large-scale smooth problems**: L-BFGS standard (efficient on appropriate problems)

### Problem-Specific Triggers
- **Convex quadratic**: Use QQN-Bisection variants (100% success expected)
- **Neural networks**: Use Adam-Fast (32.5-60% success rates)
- **Rosenbrock-type**: Consider GD-WeightDecay first (70% success on 2D)
- **Highly multimodal**: Start with Adam-Fast, fallback to QQN-StrongWolfe

### Decision Criteria
- **Function evaluations < 100 required**: Choose QQN variants
- **Success rate > 50% required**: Avoid standard Adam/GD on complex problems
- **High-dimensional (>10D)**: Prefer Adam-Fast for multimodal, QQN for convex
- **Unknown problem structure**: Use QQN-Bisection-1 as robust default

### Pipeline Integration Strategy
Implement a cascaded approach:
1. **Phase 1**: QQN-Bisection-1 (50 evaluations max)
2. **Phase 2**: If unsuccessful, switch to Adam-Fast (200 evaluations)
3. **Phase 3**: Problem-specific fallback based on detected characteristics

This strategy leverages the 54.2% problem-winning rate of QQN variants while maintaining robustness through adaptive algorithm selection.
