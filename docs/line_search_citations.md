## Original seminal papers establish theoretical foundations

The mathematical framework for modern line search methods emerged through several landmark contributions. **Armijo's 1966 paper introduced the fundamental sufficient decrease condition**, establishing the requirement f(α) ≤ f(0) + c₁αf'(0) that ensures adequate progress along search directions. This Pacific Journal of Mathematics paper (Volume 16, pages 1-3, DOI: 10.2140/pjm.1966.16.1) provided the foundation for backtracking line search methods still widely used today.

**Wolfe's 1969 SIAM Review paper "Convergence Conditions for Ascent Methods" added the crucial curvature condition**, creating the complete Wolfe conditions framework. Published in Volume 11, Issue 2, pages 226-235 with DOI 10.1137/1011036, this work established both weak and strong Wolfe conditions, with the strong version using |∇f(x + αp)ᵀp| ≤ c₂|∇f(x)ᵀp| to prevent overly small steps. These conditions became standard for quasi-Newton and conjugate gradient algorithms.

The **More-Thuente algorithm represents the most influential practical implementation**, detailed in their 1994 ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software paper "Line Search Algorithms with Guaranteed Sufficient Decrease" (Volume 20, Issue 3, pages 286-307, DOI: 10.1145/192115.192132). This work provided a robust algorithm guaranteeing finite convergence to points satisfying Wolfe conditions, becoming one of the most widely implemented line search procedures in optimization software.

**Golden section search traces to Kiefer's 1953 foundational work** "Sequential minimax search for a maximum" in Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society (Volume 4, pages 502-506, DOI: 10.2307/2032161). This established the optimal reduction strategy using the golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 for unimodal function optimization. Supporting theoretical development came from Avriel and Wilde's 1966 Fibonacci Quarterly paper (Volume 4, Issue 3, pages 265-269) proving optimality of the symmetric approach.

## Classic optimization textbooks provide comprehensive treatment

**Nocedal and Wright's "Numerical Optimization" stands as the definitive modern reference**. The second edition (Springer, 2006, ISBN: 978-0387303031, 664 pages) devotes Chapter 3 entirely to line search methods, covering Wolfe conditions, step-length selection algorithms, the More-Thuente algorithm, and convergence analysis. This treatment integrates seamlessly with steepest descent, Newton's method, and quasi-Newton approaches, making it the gold standard for both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

**Dennis and Schnabel's "Numerical Methods for Unconstrained Optimization and Nonlinear Equations"** provides equally authoritative coverage in its SIAM Classics edition (1996, ISBN: 978-0898713640, 378 pages). Chapters 6-8 deliver comprehensive theoretical treatment of line search algorithms, detailed analysis of Armijo and Wolfe conditions, backtracking strategies, and integration with Newton and quasi-Newton methods. This text remains the definitive reference for unconstrained optimization theory.

**Fletcher's "Practical Methods of Optimization"** (second edition, Wiley, 2000, ISBN: 978-0471494638, 436 pages) emphasizes practical implementation throughout Chapter 2 and integrated sections. Fletcher's treatment focuses on real-world considerations and implementation details, complementing the more theoretical approaches of other texts.

Additional essential references include **Bertsekas's "Nonlinear Programming"** (third edition, Athena Scientific, 2016, ISBN: 978-1886529052, 880 pages) for rigorous mathematical treatment in Chapter 1, and **Bazaraa, Sherali, and Shetty's "Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms"** (third edition, Wiley, 2006, ISBN: 978-0471486008) for comprehensive coverage in Chapters 8-9.

## Recent research advances implementation and performance analysis

**Modern integration with machine learning has driven significant algorithmic innovations**. Berahas, Jahani, and Takáč's 2022 Computational Optimization and Applications paper "Quasi-Newton methods for deep learning: Forget the past, just sample" (Volume 83, pages 1-33, DOI: 10.1007/s10589-022-00381-5) demonstrates successful integration of quasi-Newton methods with stochastic line search for large-scale applications, addressing scalability challenges in modern optimization.

**Bayesian approaches represent cutting-edge developments in line search efficiency**. Prusina and Laue's 2025 Lecture Notes in Computer Science paper "Efficient Line Search Method Based on Regression and Uncertainty Quantification" (LION 2024, Volume 14990, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-75623-8_26) introduces novel Bayesian optimization approaches that utilize all available data points rather than traditional interval-based methods, demonstrating superior performance on CUTEst test problems.

**Stochastic line search methods address modern computational challenges**. Cartis, Gould, and Toint's 2019 SIAM Journal on Optimization paper "A stochastic line search method with expected complexity analysis" (Volume 29, Issue 2, pages 1532-1568, DOI: 10.1137/18M1216250) provides rigorous complexity analysis and empirical comparisons showing competitive performance with reduced computational requirements. This work establishes expected complexity bounds and practical implementation strategies for noisy optimization problems.

**Nonmonotone line search techniques have gained significant attention**. Zhang and Hager's 2004 SIAM Journal on Optimization paper "A nonmonotone line search technique and its application to unconstrained optimization" (Volume 14, Issue 4, pages 1043-1056, DOI: 10.1137/S1052623403428208) demonstrates improved performance for L-BFGS through extensive numerical comparison on CUTE library problems.

## Mathematical foundations and parameter configuration guidance

**Standard parameter recommendations have emerged from extensive empirical analysis**. The widely adopted default values c₁ = 10⁻⁴ and c₂ = 0.9 for Wolfe conditions are recommended in Nocedal and Wright's text and implemented in major software libraries including SciPy. These values balance sufficient decrease requirements with practical convergence rates across diverse problem classes.

**Computational complexity analysis provides theoretical guarantees**. Gratton, Sartenaer, and Tshimanga's 2024 Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications paper "Worst Case Complexity Bounds for Linesearch-Type Derivative-Free Algorithms" (DOI: 10.1007/s10957-024-02519-x) establishes O(ε⁻²) iteration complexity bounds for derivative-free line search methods. Complementary analysis by Cartis and Scheinberg in Mathematical Programming (2018, Volume 169, pages 337-375) provides rigorous complexity analysis for various line search approaches.

**Adaptive parameter selection strategies represent an active research area**. Ibrahim, Yunus, Moghrabi, Waziri, and Sambas's 2025 Results in Control and Optimization survey "A brief survey of line search methods for optimization problems" (Volume 19, 100550, DOI: 10.1016/j.rico.2025.100550) provides comprehensive coverage of modern adaptive approaches and practical implementation guidelines.

## Specialized applications and modern variants

**Constrained optimization applications require modified approaches**. Gill and Robinson's 2021 arXiv paper "Projected-Search Methods for Bound-Constrained Optimization" (arXiv:2110.08359) develops quasi-Wolfe line search methods for piecewise differentiable functions, addressing limitations of traditional Armijo conditions in constrained settings with substantial performance improvements.

**Distributed computing implementations enable large-scale applications**. Hynes and De Sterck's 2015 study of polynomial expansion line search implemented in Apache Spark (arXiv:1510.08345) demonstrates 1.8-2x speedup over traditional Wolfe line search in large-scale experiments on 16-node clusters with 256 cores, addressing practical scalability requirements.

**Integration with modern optimization methods continues evolving**. Yuan and Lu's 2017 Applied Mathematics and Computation paper "Global convergence of BFGS and PRP methods under a modified weak Wolfe–Powell line search" (Volume 295, pages 179-189, DOI: 10.1016/j.amc.2016.10.014) establishes theoretical convergence results and provides computational comparisons demonstrating improved performance over standard implementations.
