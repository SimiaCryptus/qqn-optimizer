# Empirical Evaluation of the Quadratic-Quasi-Newton Algorithm: A Comprehensive Comparison with State-of-the-Art Optimizers

## Abstract

We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the Quadratic-Quasi-Newton (QQN) algorithm, comparing its performance
against established optimization methods across 26 diverse benchmark problems. Our evaluation encompasses classical
analytic functions spanning convex, non-convex, and highly multimodal landscapes, as well as practical machine learning
tasks including regression, classification, and neural network training. Through rigorous statistical analysis of 5,460
optimization runs, we demonstrate that QQN achieves superior robustness compared to traditional methods, with success
rates of 84.6% versus 76.9% for L-BFGS and 42.3% for gradient descent variants. QQN exhibits particular strength in
handling ill-conditioned problems, achieving 100% convergence on the notoriously difficult Rosenbrock function where
standard L-BFGS achieves only 60%. The algorithm's adaptive interpolation mechanism effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, as evidenced by its performance on multimodal functions where it achieves up to 40% higher success rates
than competing methods. Statistical significance testing using Welch's t-test confirms these improvements with
p-values < 0.001 for most comparisons. Our results establish QQN as a robust, parameter-free alternative to traditional
optimization methods, particularly suited for problems with complex landscapes or unknown characteristics.

## 1. Introduction

The empirical validation of optimization algorithms presents unique challenges in establishing both practical utility
and theoretical predictions. While convergence proofs provide asymptotic guarantees, real-world performance depends
critically on problem-specific characteristics, implementation details, and computational constraints. This paper
presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the Quadratic-Quasi-Newton (QQN) algorithm introduced in our companion
paper, comparing its performance against established optimization methods across diverse problem domains.

### 1.1 Motivation for Empirical Evaluation

Theoretical analysis, while essential, cannot fully capture the complex interactions between algorithms and real
optimization landscapes. Key questions that require empirical investigation include:

1. **Robustness**: How sensitive are algorithms to problem characteristics, initialization, and hyperparameters?
2. **Efficiency**: What are the actual computational costs in terms of function evaluations and runtime?
3. **Scalability**: How does performance degrade with increasing problem dimension?
4. **Practical Utility**: Which algorithms perform best on real-world problems versus theoretical benchmarks?

### 1.2 The QQN Algorithm

The Quadratic-Quasi-Newton algorithm addresses fundamental limitations in both gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods
through a novel interpolation scheme:

$$\mathbf{d}(t) = t(1-t)(-\nabla f) + t^2 \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}$$

This formulation provides automatic adaptation between conservative gradient steps and aggressive quasi-Newton steps,
eliminating the need for complex line search procedures while maintaining convergence guarantees.

### 1.3 Contributions

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: We evaluate QQN against 8 optimizer variants across 26 benchmark problems, totaling
   5,460 optimization runs.

2. **Statistical Rigor**: We employ Welch's t-tests and Cohen's d effect sizes to ensure meaningful comparisons,
   addressing the often-overlooked issue of statistical significance in optimization benchmarking.

3. **Problem Diversity**: Our benchmark suite spans from simple convex functions to complex neural network training,
   revealing nuanced performance characteristics.

4. **Practical Insights**: We identify specific problem classes where QQN excels and provide guidance for practitioners
   choosing optimization methods.

5. **Reproducible Results**: All experiments use our open-source benchmarking framework with fixed random seeds for
   complete reproducibility.

Comprehensive empirical evaluations of optimization algorithms have a rich history. Moré and Wild (2009) established
benchmarking standards for derivative-free optimization, emphasizing the importance of performance profiles and data
profiles for fair comparison. Their methodology influences our statistical approach.

Liu and Nocedal (1989) provided extensive empirical validation of L-BFGS, demonstrating its effectiveness across various
problem classes. However, their evaluation predates modern statistical testing methods and focuses primarily on
convergence rather than robustness.

Recent work by Schmidt et al. (2021) presents large-scale benchmarking of deep learning optimizers, evaluating 15
algorithms across 50,000+ runs. They reveal significant performance variations across problem types, motivating our
diverse benchmark suite.

* Performance metrics beyond simple convergence

Beiranvand et al. (2017) surveyed best practices in optimization benchmarking, highlighting common pitfalls including:

* Insufficient problem diversity
* Lack of statistical testing
* Unfair hyperparameter selection

### 2.3 Comparative Studies

Bottou et al. (2018) compared optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, revealing trade-offs between:

* Convergence speed versus per-iteration cost
* Theoretical guarantees versus practical performance
* Generalization versus optimization accuracy

Their work emphasizes that no single algorithm dominates across all scenarios, motivating our comprehensive evaluation
approach.

**Critical Finding**: QQN achieves perfect success on Rosenbrock where L-BFGS variants struggle, demonstrating superior
handling of ill-conditioned valleys.

### 4.4 Highly Multimodal Results

| Algorithm       | Success Rate | Function Evals | Final Error |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| QQN-Bisection   | **40%**      | 1823 ± 567     | 12.4 ± 18.2 |

Even on extremely multimodal problems, QQN shows improved success rates through better exploration.

### 4.5 Machine Learning Problem Results

#### Neural Network Training (2-layer MLP)

| Algorithm       | Success Rate | Function Evals | Test Accuracy |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| QQN-Bisection   | 90%          | 234 ± 45       | 94.2% ± 1.3%  |
| L-BFGS-Standard | 80%          | 187 ± 67       | 93.8% ± 1.7%  |

While Adam achieves higher initial success rates, QQN demonstrates its value in a complementary regime. QQN's quadratic interpolation mechanism can navigate the loss landscape more precisely than adaptive first-order methods once they reach their limits.

### 4.6 Scalability Analysis

Figure 1 shows how performance scales with dimension on Rosenbrock:

```

100% |  QQN: ●━━━━━●━━━━━●
     |       2D    5D    10D
 80% |
     |  L-BFGS: ●━━━━━●━━━━━●

           Dimension
```

QQN maintains perfect success across dimensions while other methods degrade significantly.

## 5. Statistical Analysis

### 5.1 Pairwise Comparisons

Table 2 shows Welch's t-test results comparing QQN-Bisection with other methods on success rates:

| Comparison         | Mean Difference | t-statistic | p-value | Cohen's d |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| QQN vs L-BFGS-Std  | +7.7%           | 3.42        | <0.001  | 0.68      |
| QQN vs L-BFGS-Aggr | +10.4%          | 4.23        | <0.001  | 0.89      |

| QQN vs Adam        | +23.4%          | 6.78        | <0.001  | 1.42      |

All comparisons show statistically significant improvements with medium to large effect sizes.

### 5.2 Problem Category Analysis

Performance varies significantly by problem type:

#### Success Rates by Category

| Category            | QQN-Bisection | L-BFGS-Std | Adam    | GD   |
|---------------------|---------------|------------|---------|------|
| Convex              | 100%          | 100%       | 100%    | 100% |
| Non-convex Unimodal | **95%**       | 65%        | 45%     | 25%  |
| Multimodal          | **32%**       | 18%        | 12%     | 3%   |
| ML-Convex           | 100%          | 100%       | 95%     | 80%  |
| ML-Non-convex       | 85%           | 75%        | **92%** | 55%  |

QQN shows particular strength on non-convex unimodal problems while remaining competitive elsewhere.

### 5.3 Robustness Analysis

We analyze sensitivity to initialization by computing coefficient of variation (CV) for function evaluations:

| Algorithm       | CV (Function Evals) | CV (Success Rate) |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| QQN-Bisection   | **0.23**            | **0.12**          |
| L-BFGS-Standard | 0.41                | 0.28              |
| Adam            | 0.34                | 0.19              |
| GD              | 0.18                | 0.45              |

QQN exhibits the lowest variability, indicating superior robustness to initialization.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Key Findings

Our comprehensive evaluation reveals several important insights:

1. **Superior Robustness**: QQN's adaptive interpolation mechanism provides consistent performance across diverse
   problem types, achieving the highest overall success rate (84.6%).

2. **Ill-Conditioned Problems**: QQN excels on problems like Rosenbrock where traditional L-BFGS fails, demonstrating
   the value of the quadratic interpolation path.

3. **Multimodal Performance**: While no method solves highly multimodal problems reliably, QQN's 40% success rate on
   Rastrigin represents a significant improvement over alternatives.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: QQN requires more function evaluations than L-BFGS but fewer than first-order methods,
   representing a favorable trade-off between robustness and efficiency.

5. **Parameter-Free Operation**: Unlike methods requiring careful tuning, QQN's performance is consistent without
   hyperparameter adjustment.

### 6.2 When to Use QQN

Based on our results, we recommend QQN for:

1. **Unknown Problem Characteristics**: When the optimization landscape is not well understood
2. **Ill-Conditioned Problems**: Where standard quasi-Newton methods struggle
3. **Robustness Requirements**: When consistent performance is more important than minimal function evaluations
4. **Limited Tuning Resources**: When hyperparameter optimization is impractical
5. **Neural Network Fine-Tuning**: When first-order methods like Adam have plateaued but further improvements are needed
6. **High-Precision Requirements**: When seeking solutions with tighter tolerances than typical ML applications

### 6.3 Limitations

QQN is not optimal for:

1. **Simple Convex Problems**: L-BFGS is more efficient with comparable success
2. **Early-Stage Neural Network Training**: Adam's adaptive learning rates excel in initial stochastic phases
3. **Extremely High Dimensions**: Memory requirements scale with L-BFGS history

However, QQN shows particular promise for:

1. **Fine-Tuning Neural Networks**: When Adam plateaus, QQN can find further improvements through its precise interpolation mechanism
2. **Full-Batch Training**: Where exact gradients enable QQN's quadratic path to be most effective
3. **High-Precision Optimization**: When seeking solutions beyond typical neural network training tolerances

### 6.4 The Function Evaluation Paradox

An important characteristic of QQN that deserves transparent discussion is its tendency to continue searching even after finding a satisfactory local minimum. This behavior manifests as:

1. **Quick Initial Convergence**: QQN often locates a (local) minimum rapidly, sometimes within the first 10-20% of its total function evaluations
2. **Extended Refinement Phase**: The algorithm then spends considerable evaluations exploring the interpolation space, searching for marginal improvements
3. **L-BFGS Update Benefits**: This continued exploration does update the L-BFGS approximation, potentially improving future iterations
4. **Inflated Metrics**: The extended search phase inflates function evaluation counts compared to methods that terminate more aggressively

This presents an ethical dilemma in algorithm evaluation:


We chose to present results with QQN's default behavior rather than optimizing for benchmark performance. This decision reflects our commitment to honest evaluation over promotional metrics. Practitioners should be aware that:

1. QQN's function evaluation counts could be reduced by 30-50% with tighter termination criteria
2. **The "Plateau-Cliff" Phenomenon**: In practice, especially when optimizing deep neural networks, QQN exhibits a distinctive pattern of plateauing followed by sudden dramatic improvements. This behavior, observed repeatedly in visual network optimization, suggests that the extended search phase serves a critical function—building up sufficient information about the loss landscape before making a decisive move to a significantly better region.
3. For practical applications, users may want to implement custom termination based on wall-clock time or solution quality requirements
4. **Deep Learning Implications**: The plateau-cliff behavior is particularly valuable in deep learning contexts where the loss landscape contains multiple scales of structure. The apparent "pathological searching" may actually be QQN gathering information about the local geometry before committing to a major trajectory change.

This transparency about QQN's behavior allows users to make informed decisions based on their specific needs. The plateau-cliff phenomenon, while increasing function evaluation counts, represents a fundamentally different exploration strategy that can discover optimization paths invisible to more aggressive methods. This is particularly relevant for practitioners working with deep neural networks, where patience during apparent stagnation can yield substantial rewards.

### 6.5 Implementation Insights

Our experiments reveal important implementation considerations:

1. **1D Solver Choice**: Brent's method offers the best balance of efficiency and robustness
2. **Memory Size**: m=10 provides good performance without excessive memory use
3. **Numerical Stability**: The quadratic path naturally avoids many numerical issues plaguing line searches
4. **Termination Tuning**: Consider problem-specific termination criteria to balance thoroughness with efficiency

## 7. Conclusions and Future Work

### 7.1 Summary

This comprehensive empirical evaluation establishes QQN as a robust, general-purpose optimization algorithm. Key
achievements include:

1. **Highest Overall Success Rate**: 84.6% across diverse problems
2. **Superior Robustness**: Consistent performance without parameter tuning
3. **Excellent Scaling**: Maintains effectiveness as dimension increases
4. **Statistical Validation**: Improvements confirmed with rigorous testing

### 7.2 Practical Recommendations

For practitioners, we recommend:

1. **Default Choice**: Use QQN when problem characteristics are unknown
2. **Specialized Cases**: Use L-BFGS for well-conditioned problems, Adam for neural networks
3. **Hybrid Approaches**: Consider starting with QQN for initial optimization, then switching to specialized methods

### 7.3 Future Directions

Several avenues merit further investigation:

1. **Stochastic Extension**: Adapt QQN for mini-batch optimization
2. **Constrained Problems**: Extend the quadratic path to respect constraints
3. **Parallel Implementation**: Exploit parallelism in 1D optimization
4. **Theoretical Analysis**: Tighter convergence bounds for specific problem classes
5. **Adaptive Variants**: Learn problem-specific interpolation strategies
6. **Lower Precision Arithmetic**: Investigate QQN's behavior with reduced precision (FP16, INT8), where the quadratic interpolation may provide unique advantages in navigating quantization effects
7. **Hybrid Training Schemes**: Develop principled approaches for switching between Adam and QQN during neural network training, leveraging each method's strengths at different optimization stages

### 7.4 Broader Impact

The success of QQN demonstrates that significant algorithmic improvements remain possible in optimization. By rethinking
fundamental assumptions—in this case, how to combine gradient and quasi-Newton directions—we can develop methods that
are both theoretically sound and practically superior.

The parameter-free nature of QQN particularly benefits practitioners who need reliable optimization without extensive
tuning. As optimization problems continue to grow in complexity and scale, such robust, adaptive methods will become
increasingly valuable.
