# QQN Algorithm: An Intuitive Derivation

## The Problem We're Solving

Imagine you're standing on a mountainside in thick fog, trying to find the lowest point. You have two advisors giving
you directions:

1. **The Conservative Guide (Gradient)**: Always points directly downhill from where you stand. Safe, but might take
   forever on gentle slopes.
2. **The Aggressive Guide (L-BFGS)**: Uses memory of recent terrain to make educated guesses about shortcuts. Fast when
   right, but can be wildly wrong.

The question is: how do we combine their advice intelligently?

## Setting Up the Mathematical Framework

Let's start with what we have at any point in our optimization:

* **Current parameters**: `x` (our current position)
* **Gradient**: `∇f(x)` (steepest ascent direction)
* **Negative gradient**: `-∇f(x)` (steepest descent direction)
* **L-BFGS direction**: `d_lbfgs` (quasi-Newton guess for best direction)

The key insight is to treat this as a **1-dimensional optimization problem**. Instead of trying to figure out the
optimal step in the full parameter space, we'll define a path and then just optimize along that path.

## Constructing the Path

We want to create a parametric path that smoothly interpolates between our two directional advisors. Let's call our path
parameter `t`, where `t ∈ [0, 1]`.

Our intuition says we want:

* At `t = 0`: Follow the conservative gradient advice
* At `t = 1`: Follow the aggressive L-BFGS advice
* For `0 < t < 1`: Some blend of both

The simplest way to achieve this is with linear interpolation:

```
direction(t) = (1-t) × (-∇f) + t × d_lbfgs
```

This gives us a **unit direction** - it tells us which way to go, but not how far.

## The Missing Piece: Scaling by Distance

Here's the crucial insight that completes the picture: **the direction needs to be scaled by how far we actually want to
move**.

If we just used `direction(t)` directly, we'd always take a step of some fixed magnitude determined by the relative
sizes of our gradient and L-BFGS vectors. But we want `t` to represent both the blend of directions AND the step size.

So our actual step becomes:

```
step(t) = t × direction(t) = t × [(1-t) × (-∇f) + t × d_lbfgs]
```

Expanding this:

```
step(t) = t(1-t) × (-∇f) + t² × d_lbfgs
```

## Why This Formula Makes Sense

Let's examine what happens at the boundaries:

**At t = 0:**

```
step(0) = 0(1-0) × (-∇f) + 0² × d_lbfgs = 0
```

We don't move at all. This makes sense - we're starting from our current position.

**At t = 1:**

```
step(1) = 1(1-1) × (-∇f) + 1² × d_lbfgs = d_lbfgs
```

We take a full step in the L-BFGS direction.

**For small t (conservative steps):**

```
step(t) ≈ t × (-∇f)
```

We move primarily in the gradient direction, with step size proportional to `t`.

**The derivative at t = 0:**

```
d/dt step(t)|_{t=0} = (1-2t) × (-∇f) + 2t × d_lbfgs|_{t=0} = -∇f
```

Our initial direction is pure gradient descent, which guarantees we start moving downhill.

## The Geometric Intuition

The path `step(t)` traces out a **quadratic curve** in parameter space:

* It starts at the origin (current position)
* Initially heads in the gradient direction
* Curves toward the L-BFGS direction
* The amount of curvature depends on how different the two directions are

This quadratic nature is why it's called "Quadratic-Quasi-Newton" - we're using a quadratic path to interpolate between
Newton-like and gradient-like steps.

## Converting to 1D Optimization

Now we have a beautiful 1D optimization problem: find the value of `t` that minimizes:

```
f(x_current + step(t))
```

where `step(t) = t(1-t) × (-∇f) + t² × d_lbfgs`

This is much easier than the original multi-dimensional problem! We can use any 1D line search method (golden section,
Brent's method, etc.) to find the optimal `t*`.

## The Complete Algorithm

1. **Compute directions**: Calculate `-∇f` and `d_lbfgs` at current position
2. **Define quadratic path**: `step(t) = t(1-t) × (-∇f) + t² × d_lbfgs`
3. **1D optimization**: Find `t*` that minimizes `f(x + step(t))`
4. **Update parameters**: `x_new = x_old + step(t*)`
5. **Update L-BFGS memory**: Store the step and gradient change for future iterations

## Why This Works So Well

The genius of this approach is that it:

* **Guarantees descent**: The initial direction is always downhill
* **Adapts automatically**: If L-BFGS direction is good, `t*` will be close to 1. If it's bad, `t*` will be small and
  we'll mostly follow the gradient
* **Provides smooth interpolation**: No abrupt switches between methods
* **Reduces to known methods**: Pure gradient descent when `t* ≈ 0`, pure L-BFGS when `t* ≈ 1`
* **Handles edge cases gracefully**: Even if L-BFGS gives a terrible direction, we can always fall back to gradient
  descent

The quadratic interpolation gives us the best of both worlds: the reliability of gradient descent with the speed of
quasi-Newton methods, automatically balanced based on what the function actually looks like along our search path.

## Key Benefits Over Traditional Methods

### Simplified L-BFGS Implementation

One of the most significant advantages of QQN is that it **dramatically simplifies the L-BFGS algorithm**. Traditional
L-BFGS implementations require:

* Complex line search procedures with Wolfe conditions
* Careful handling of step size initialization
* Multiple fallback strategies when the quasi-Newton direction fails
* Intricate logic for handling edge cases and numerical issues
  With QQN, we strip away this complexity. We only need L-BFGS to provide a **quasi-Newton guess** for the direction.
  The 1D optimization along our quadratic path automatically handles:
* Step size selection
* Ensuring sufficient decrease
* Fallback to gradient descent when needed
* All edge cases through the natural behavior of the interpolation
  This means the L-BFGS component can be much simpler - it just needs to maintain its memory and produce a direction
  estimate. All the robustness comes from the QQN framework itself.

### Essentially Parameter-Free

Another remarkable property of QQN is that it's **essentially parameter-free**. Unlike traditional optimization methods
that require careful tuning of:

* Initial step sizes
* Line search parameters (c1, c2 for Wolfe conditions)
* Trust region radii
* Momentum coefficients
* Learning rate schedules
  QQN has no essential hyperparameters of its own. The only parameters in the implementation belong to:

1. **Component elements**: Like the memory size for L-BFGS (typically 5-10, not sensitive)
2. **Nonessential thresholds**: Like convergence tolerances or maximum iterations
3. **1D search method**: Which typically has robust defaults
   This parameter-free nature means:

* No hyperparameter tuning needed
* Consistent behavior across different problems
* Easy to use as a drop-in replacement
* Reduced risk of misconfiguration
* More time spent on the actual problem rather than optimizer tuning
  The algorithm automatically adapts to the problem at hand through the 1D optimization, finding the right balance
  between gradient and quasi-Newton steps without any user intervention.
