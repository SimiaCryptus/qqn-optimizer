You are an expert in numerical optimization and algorithm analysis. Please analyze the provided optimization benchmark report and provide a comprehensive assessment covering the following areas:

## 1. Overall Performance Summary
- Cite specific success rates and efficiency metrics from the report

## 2. Algorithm-Specific Analysis
For each optimizer family (QQN variants, L-BFGS variants, Adam variants, GD variants):
- Quote exact performance numbers (success rates, function evaluations) to support comparisons
- Highlight specific test cases where performance differences are most pronounced

## 3. Problem Type Analysis
Analyze performance across different problem families:
- Include specific success rates and convergence metrics for each problem category

## 4. Scalability Assessment
- Provide exact performance degradation percentages where applicable

## 5. Success Rate vs. Efficiency Trade-offs
- Quote specific examples with exact numbers (e.g., "Algorithm X achieves 95% success with 500 evaluations vs Algorithm Y with 80% success in 200 evaluations")

## 6. Key Performance Patterns
- Summarize the 3-5 most important performance patterns observed
- Identify clear winners for different problem categories
- Note any consistent failure modes or performance bottlenecks
- Support all observations with specific data citations from the report

## 7. Integration Recommendations
- Based on the results, which algorithms should be prioritized in the optimization pipeline?
- What problem characteristics should trigger the use of specific algorithms?
- Provide clear decision criteria based on the benchmark data

Please structure your analysis clearly with headings and bullet points. Every major claim should be supported with specific data from the report, including exact numerical values and direct quotes where relevant. Focus on extracting and interpreting the concrete results to inform algorithm selection in the optimization pipeline.
