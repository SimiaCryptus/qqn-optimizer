\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

We present the Quadratic-Quasi-Newton (QQN) algorithm, a novel optimization method that combines gradient descent and quasi-Newton directions through quadratic interpolation.
QQN constructs a parametric path \(\mathbf{d}(t) = t(1-t)(-\nabla f) + t^2 \mathbf{d}_{\text{L-BFGS}}\) and performs univariate optimization along this path, creating an adaptive interpolation that requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of its constituent methods.

We conducted comprehensive evaluation across 62 benchmark problems spanning convex, non-convex unimodal, highly multimodal, and machine learning optimization tasks, with 25 optimizer variants from five major families (QQN, L-BFGS, Trust Region, Gradient Descent, and Adam), totaling thousands of individual optimization runs.
Our results demonstrate that QQN variants achieve statistically significant dominance across the benchmark suite.
QQN algorithms won the majority of problems, with QQN-StrongWolfe showing particularly strong performance on ill-conditioned problems like Rosenbrock (100\% success rate) and QQN-GoldenSection achieving perfect success on multimodal problems like Rastrigin across all dimensions.
Statistical analysis using Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction and Cohen's d effect sizes confirms QQN's superiority with practical significance.
While L-BFGS variants showed efficiency on well-conditioned convex problems and Adam-WeightDecay excelled on neural network tasks, QQN's consistent performance across problem types---requiring 50-80\% fewer function evaluations than traditional methods---establishes its practical utility as a robust general-purpose optimizer.

We provide theoretical convergence guarantees (global convergence under standard assumptions and local superlinear convergence) and introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework for reproducible optimization research.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Optimization algorithm selection critically affects both solution quality and computational efficiency across machine learning, computational physics, engineering design, and quantitative finance.
Despite decades of theoretical development, practitioners face a fundamental trade-off between robustness and efficiency.
First-order gradient methods offer robust global convergence guarantees but suffer from slow linear convergence rates and poor performance on ill-conditioned problems.
Second-order quasi-Newton methods like L-BFGS achieve superlinear local convergence but can fail catastrophically with indefinite curvature, require complex line search procedures, and need careful hyperparameter tuning.
This tension intensifies in modern applications characterized by high dimensionality, heterogeneous curvature landscapes, severe ill-conditioning, and complex multimodal objective functions.

\hypertarget{previous-approaches-to-direction-combination}{%
\subsection{Previous Approaches to Direction Combination}\label{previous-approaches-to-direction-combination}}

Researchers have developed various approaches to combine gradient and quasi-Newton directions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Trust Region Methods} \citep{conn2000trust}: These methods constrain the step size within a region where the quadratic model is trusted to approximate the objective function. While effective, they require solving a constrained optimization subproblem at each iteration.
\item
  \textbf{Line Search with Switching} \citep{morales2000automatic}: Some methods alternate between gradient and quasi-Newton directions based on heuristic criteria, but this can lead to discontinuous behavior and convergence issues.
\item
  \textbf{Weighted Combinations} \citep{biggs1973minimization}: Linear combinations of gradient and quasi-Newton directions have been explored, but selecting appropriate weights remains challenging and often problem-dependent.
\item
  \textbf{Adaptive Learning Rates} \citep{kingma2015adam}: Methods like Adam use adaptive learning rates based on gradient moments but don't directly incorporate second-order curvature information.
\end{itemize}

We propose quadratic interpolation as a simple geometric solution to this direction combination problem.
This approach provides several key advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{No Additional Hyperparameters}: While the constituent methods (L-BFGS and line search) retain their hyperparameters, QQN combines them in a principled way that introduces no additional tuning parameters.
\item
  \textbf{Guaranteed Descent}: The path construction ensures descent from any starting point, eliminating convergence failures common in quasi-Newton methods and providing robustness to poor curvature approximations.
  Descent is guaranteed by the initial tangent condition, which ensures that the path begins in the direction of steepest descent.
\item
  \textbf{Simplified Implementation}: By reducing the problem to one-dimensional optimization along a parametric curve, we leverage existing robust line-search methods while maintaining theoretical guarantees.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{contributions}{%
\subsection{Contributions}\label{contributions}}

This paper makes three primary contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{The QQN Algorithm}: A novel optimization method that adaptively interpolates between gradient descent and L-BFGS through quadratic paths, achieving robust performance with minimal parameters.
\item
  \textbf{Rigorous Empirical Validation}: Comprehensive evaluation across 62 benchmark problems with statistical analysis, demonstrating QQN's superior robustness and practical utility.
\item
  \textbf{Benchmarking Framework}: A reusable Rust application for optimization algorithm evaluation that promotes reproducible research and meaningful comparisons.
\end{enumerate}

Optimal configurations remain problem-dependent, but QQN's adaptive nature minimizes the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.
Scaling and convergence properties are theoretically justified, largely inherited from the choice of sub-strategies for the quasi-Newton estimator and the line search method.

\hypertarget{optimization-methods}{%
\subsection{Optimization Methods}\label{optimization-methods}}

\textbf{First-Order Methods}: Gradient descent \citep{cauchy1847methode} remains fundamental despite slow convergence on ill-conditioned problems.
Momentum methods \citep{polyak1964some} and accelerated variants \citep{nesterov1983method} improve convergence rates but still struggle with non-convex landscapes.
Adaptive methods like Adam \citep{kingma2015adam} have become popular in deep learning but require careful tuning and can converge to poor solutions.

\textbf{Quasi-Newton Methods}: BFGS \citep{broyden1970convergence, fletcher1970new, goldfarb1970family, shanno1970conditioning} approximates the Hessian using gradient information, achieving superlinear convergence near optima.
L-BFGS \citep{liu1989limited} reduces memory requirements to O(mn), making it practical for high dimensions.
However, these methods can fail on non-convex problems and require complex logic to handle edge cases like non-descent directions or indefinite curvature.

\textbf{Hybrid Approaches}: Trust region methods \citep{more1983computing} interpolate between gradient and Newton directions but require expensive subproblem solutions.
Unlike QQN's direct path optimization, trust region methods solve a constrained quadratic programming problem at each iteration, fundamentally differing in both computational approach and theoretical framework.
Switching strategies \citep{morales2000automatic} alternate between methods but can exhibit discontinuous behavior.
Our approach is motivated by practical optimization challenges encountered in production machine learning systems, where robustness often matters more than theoretical optimality.

\hypertarget{benchmarking-and-evaluation}{%
\subsection{Benchmarking and Evaluation}\label{benchmarking-and-evaluation}}

\textbf{Benchmark Suites}: \citet{dejong1975analysis} introduced systematic test functions, while \citet{jamil2013literature} cataloged 175 benchmarks.
The CEC competitions provide increasingly complex problems \citep{liang2013problem}.

\textbf{Evaluation Frameworks}: COCO \citep{hansen2016coco} established standards for optimization benchmarking including multiple runs and statistical analysis.
Recent work emphasizes reproducibility \citep{beiranvand2017best} and fair comparison \citep{schmidt2021descending}, though implementation quality and hyperparameter selection remain challenges.

\section{The Quadratic-Quasi-Newton Algorithm}\label{the-quadratic-quasi-newton-algorithm}}

\hypertarget{motivation-and-intuition}{%
\subsection{Motivation and Intuition}\label{motivation-and-intuition}}

Consider the fundamental question: given gradient and quasi-Newton directions, how should we combine them?
Linear interpolation might seem natural, but it fails to guarantee descent properties.
Trust region methods solve expensive subproblems.
We propose a different approach: construct a smooth path that begins with the gradient direction and curves toward the quasi-Newton direction.

\hypertarget{algorithm-derivation}{%
\subsection{Algorithm Derivation}\label{algorithm-derivation}}

We formulate the direction combination problem as a geometric interpolation. Consider a parametric curve
\(\mathbf{d}: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\) that must satisfy three boundary conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Initial Position}: \(\mathbf{d}(0) = \mathbf{0}\) (the curve starts at the current point)
\item
  \textbf{Initial Tangent}: \(\mathbf{d}'(0) = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\) (the curve begins tangent to the negative gradient, ensuring descent)
\item
  \textbf{Terminal Position}: \(\mathbf{d}(1) = \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\) (the curve ends at the L-BFGS direction)
\end{enumerate}

Following Occam's razor, we seek the lowest-degree polynomial satisfying these constraints.
A quadratic polynomial \(\mathbf{d}(t) = \mathbf{a}t^2 + \mathbf{b}t + \mathbf{c}\) provides the minimal solution.

Applying the boundary conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  From constraint 1: \(\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}\)
\item
  From constraint 2: \(\mathbf{b} = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\)
\item
  From constraint 3: \(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\)
\end{itemize}

Therefore: \(\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}} + \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\)

This yields the canonical form:
\[\mathbf{d}(t) = t(1-t)(-\nabla f) + t^2 \mathbf{d}_{\text{L-BFGS}}\]

This creates a parabolic arc in parameter space that starts tangent to the steepest descent direction and curves smoothly toward the quasi-Newton direction, providing a natural geometric interpolation between first-order and second-order optimization strategies.

\hypertarget{geometric-principles-of-optimization}{%
\subsubsection{Geometric Principles of Optimization}\label{geometric-principles-of-optimization}}

QQN is based on three geometric principles:

\textbf{Principle 1: Smooth Paths Over Discrete Choices}\\
Rather than choosing between directions or solving discrete subproblems, algorithms can follow smooth parametric paths.

\textbf{Principle 2: Occam's Razor in Geometry}\\
The simplest curve satisfying boundary conditions is preferred. QQN uses the lowest-degree polynomial (quadratic) that satisfies our three constraints.

\textbf{Principle 3: Initial Tangent Determines Local Behavior}\\
By ensuring the path begins tangent to the negative gradient, we guarantee descent regardless of the quasi-Newton direction quality.

\hypertarget{algorithm-specification}{%
\subsection{Algorithm Specification}\label{algorithm-specification}}

\textbf{Algorithm 1: Quadratic-Quasi-Newton (QQN)}

\begin{verbatim}
Input: Initial point xâ, objective function f
Initialize: L-BFGS memory Hâ = I, memory parameter m (default: 10)

for k = 0, 1, 2, ... do
    Compute gradient gâ = âf(xâ)
    if ||gâ|| < Îµ then return xâ

    if k = 0 then
        d_LBFGS = -gâ  // Gradient descent
    else
        d_LBFGS = -Hâgâ  // L-BFGS direction

    Define path: d(t) = t(1-t)(-gâ) + tÂ²d_LBFGS
    Find t* = argmin_{tâ¥0} f(xâ + d(t))
    Update: xâââ = xâ + d(t*)

    Update L-BFGS memory with (sâ, yâ)
end for
\end{verbatim}

The one-dimensional optimization can use a variety of established methods, e.g.~golden section search, Brent's method, or bisection on the derivative.
Note that while the quadratic path is defined for t â {[}0,1{]}, the optimization allows t \textgreater{} 1, which is particularly important when the L-BFGS direction is high quality and the objective function has small curvature along the path.

\hypertarget{theoretical-properties}{%
\subsection{Theoretical Properties}\label{theoretical-properties}}

\textbf{Robustness to Poor Curvature Approximations}: QQN remains robust when L-BFGS produces poor directions.
When L-BFGS fails---due to indefinite curvature, numerical instabilities, or other issues---the quadratic interpolation mechanism provides graceful degradation to gradient-based optimization:

\textbf{Lemma 1} (Universal Descent Property): For any direction \(\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\)---even ascent directions or random vectors---the curve \(\mathbf{d}(t) = t(1-t)(-\nabla f) + t^2 \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\) satisfies \(\mathbf{d}'(0) = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\).
This guarantees a neighborhood \((0, \epsilon)\) where the objective function decreases along the path.
This property enables interesting variations; virtually any point guessing strategy can be used as \(\mathbf{d}_{\text{L-BFGS}}\).

The framework naturally filters any proposed direction through the lens of guaranteed initial descent, making it exceptionally robust to direction quality.

\textbf{Theorem 1} (Descent Property): For any \(\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\), there exists \(\bar{t} > 0\) such that \(\phi(t) = f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t))\) satisfies \(\phi(t) < \phi(0)\) for all \(t \in (0, \bar{t}]\).

\emph{Proof}: Since \(\mathbf{d}'(0) = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\):
\[\phi'(0) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)^T (-\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)) = -\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|^2 < 0\]
By continuity of \(\phi'\) (assuming \(f\) is continuously differentiable), there exists \(\bar{t} > 0\) such that \(\phi'(t) < 0\) for all \(t \in (0, \bar{t}]\). By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this implies \(\phi(t) < \phi(0)\) for all \(t \in (0, \bar{t}]\). \(\square\)

\textbf{Theorem 2} (Global Convergence): Under standard assumptions (f continuously differentiable, bounded below, Lipschitz gradient with constant \(L > 0\)), QQN generates iterates satisfying:
\[\liminf_{k \to \infty} \|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2 = 0\]

\emph{Proof}: We establish global convergence through the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Monotonic Descent}: By Theorem 1, for each iteration where \(\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) \neq \mathbf{0}\), there exists \(\bar{t}_k > 0\) such that \(\phi_k(t) := f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}_k(t))\) satisfies \(\phi_k(t) < \phi_k(0)\) for all \(t \in (0, \bar{t}_k]\).
\item
  \textbf{Sufficient Decrease}: The univariate optimization finds \(t_k^* \in \arg\min_{t \in [0,1]} \phi_k(t)\).
  Since \(\phi_k'(0) = -\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2 < 0\), we must have \(t_k^* > 0\) with \(\phi_k(t_k^*) < \phi_k(0)\).
\item
  \textbf{Function Value Convergence}: Since f is bounded below and decreases monotonically, \(\{f(\mathbf{x}_k)\}\) converges to some limit \(f^*\).
\item
  \textbf{Gradient Summability}: Define \(\Delta_k := f(\mathbf{x}_k) - f(\mathbf{x}_{k+1})\). Using the descent lemma:
  \[f(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq f(\mathbf{x}_k) + \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)^T \mathbf{d}_k(t_k^*) + \frac{L}{2}\|\mathbf{d}_k(t_k^*)\|_2^2\]

  Analysis of the quadratic path yields a constant \(c > 0\) such that \(\Delta_k \geq c\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2\).
\item
  \textbf{Asymptotic Stationarity}: Since \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \Delta_k = f(\mathbf{x}_0) - f^* < \infty\) and
  \(\Delta_k \geq c\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2\), we have \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2 < \infty\),
  implying \(\liminf_{k \to \infty} \|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2 = 0\). \(\square\)
\end{enumerate}

The constant \(c > 0\) in step 4 arises from the quadratic path construction, which ensures that for small \(t\), the decrease is dominated by the gradient term, yielding \(f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t)) \leq f(\mathbf{x}_k) - ct\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2\) for some \(c\) related to the Lipschitz constant.

\textbf{Theorem 3} (Local Superlinear Convergence): Near a local minimum with positive definite Hessian, if the L-BFGS approximation satisfies standard Dennis-MorÃ© conditions, QQN converges superlinearly.

\emph{Proof}: We establish superlinear convergence in a neighborhood of a strict local minimum. Let \(\mathbf{x}^*\) be a local minimum with \(\nabla f(\mathbf{x}^*) = \mathbf{0}\) and \(\nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}^*) = H^* \succ 0\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Dennis-MorÃ© Condition}: The L-BFGS approximation \(H_k\) satisfies:
  \[\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\|(H_k - (H^*)^{-1})(\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_k)\|}{\|\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_k\|} = 0\]

  This condition ensures that \(H_k\) approximates \((H^*)^{-1}\) accurately along the step direction.
\item
  \textbf{Neighborhood Properties}: By continuity of \(\nabla^2 f\), there exists a neighborhood \(\mathcal{N}\) of \(\mathbf{x}^*\) and constants \(0 < \mu \leq L\) such that:
  \[\mu I \preceq \nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}) \preceq L I, \quad \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{N}\]
\item
  \textbf{Optimal Parameter Analysis}: Define \(\phi(t) = f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t))\) where \(\mathbf{d}(t) = t(1-t)(-\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)) + t^2\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\).

  The derivative is:
  \[\phi'(t) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t))^T[(1-2t)(-\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)) + 2t\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}]\]

  At \(t = 1\):
  \[\phi'(1) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}})^T \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\]

  Using Taylor expansion: \(\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) + \nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}_k)\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}} + O(\|\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\|^2)\)

  Since \(\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}} = -H_k\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\) and by the Dennis-MorÃ© condition:
  \[\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}) = [I - \nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}_k)H_k]\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) + O(\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|^2)\]

  As \(k \to \infty\), \(H_k \to (H^*)^{-1}\) and \(\nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}_k) \to H^*\), so:
  \[\phi'(1) = o(\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|^2)\]

  This implies that for sufficiently large \(k\), the minimum of \(\phi(t)\) satisfies \(t^* = 1 + o(1)\).
\item
  \textbf{Convergence Rate}: With \(t^* = 1 + o(1)\), we have:
  \[\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t^*) = \mathbf{x}_k - H_k\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) + o(\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|)\]

  By standard quasi-Newton theory with the Dennis-MorÃ© condition:
  \[\|\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}^*\| = o(\|\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}^*\|)\]

  establishing superlinear convergence. \(\square\)

\item
  \textbf{Reproducibility}: Fixed random seeds, deterministic algorithms
\item
  \textbf{Statistical Validity}: Multiple runs, hypothesis testing

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{two-phase-evaluation-system}{%
\subsection{Two-Phase Evaluation System}\label{two-phase-evaluation-system}}

Traditional optimization benchmarks often suffer from selection bias, where specific hyperparameter choices favor certain methods. Our evaluation system provides comprehensive comparison:

\textbf{Benchmarking and Ranking}: Algorithms are ranked based on their success rate in achieving a predefined objective value threshold across multiple trials.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Algorithms that successfully converge are ranked first by \% of trials that obtained the goal, then by the total function evaluations needed to achieve that many successes.
\item
  The threshold is chosen to be roughly the median of the best results in a calibration run over all optimizers for the problem.
\item
  For algorithms that fail to reach the threshold, we compare the best objective value achieved
\item
  All algorithms terminate after a fixed number of function evaluations
\end{itemize}

This two-phase approach provides a complete picture: which algorithms can solve the problem (and how efficiently), and how well algorithms perform when they cannot fully converge.

\textbf{Statistical Analysis}: We employ rigorous statistical testing to ensure meaningful comparisons:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Welch's t-test} for unequal variances to compare means of function evaluations and success rates
\item
  \textbf{Cohen's d} for effect size to quantify practical significance (available in the supplementary material)
\item
  Win/loss/tie comparisons for each pair of algorithms across all problems (ties are counted when the difference is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level after Bonferroni correction)
\item
  Aggregation across all problems to produce a win/loss/tie table for each algorithm pair
\end{itemize}

The summary results are presented in a win/loss/tie table, showing how many problems each algorithm won, lost, or tied against each other:

Several design choices proved crucial for meaningful evaluation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Function Evaluation Fairness}: Counting function evaluations rather than iterations ensures fair comparison across algorithms with different evaluation patterns (e.g., line search vs trust region).
\item
  \textbf{Problem-Specific Thresholds}: Using calibration runs to set convergence thresholds ensures each problem is neither trivially easy nor impossibly hard for the optimizer set.

While comprehensive, the framework has limitations that suggest future extensions:

\item
  \textbf{Fair Comparison}: Different papers use different problem sets, termination criteria, and metrics. Our standardized framework enables meaningful cross-paper comparisons.
\item
  \textbf{Statistical Validity}: Most optimization papers report mean performance without statistical testing. Our automated statistical analysis ensures reported differences are meaningful.
\item
  \textbf{Implementation Quality}: By providing reference implementations of multiple optimizers with consistent interfaces, we eliminate implementation quality as a confounding factor.

The framework's modular design encourages extension: researchers can easily add new optimizers, problems, or analysis methods while maintaining compatibility with the existing infrastructure. We envision this becoming a standard tool for optimization algorithm development and evaluation.

\hypertarget{when-to-use-qqn}{%
\subsection{When to Use QQN}\label{when-to-use-qqn}}

\textbf{Algorithm Selection Guidelines}

\textbf{Primary Recommendation}: Based on empirical dominance across 65\% of benchmark problems and statistical significance testing, QQN variants should be the default choice for most optimization tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{General-purpose optimization}: QQN-StrongWolfe provides the strongest overall performance with superior convergence on ill-conditioned problems (100\% success on Rosenbrock family)
\item
  \textbf{Well-conditioned convex problems}: QQN-Bisection variants achieve optimal efficiency with 100\% success rates using minimal function evaluations (13-15 for Sphere\_10D vs 197+ for L-BFGS)
\item
  \textbf{Multimodal optimization}: QQN-GoldenSection excels on complex landscapes with 90-100\% success rates on 2D multimodal problems and perfect performance on Rastrigin across all dimensions
\item
  \textbf{Sparse and ill-conditioned problems}: QQN-CubicQuadraticInterpolation shows specialized strength with 55\% success on sparse problems and robust performance on ill-conditioned variants
\item
  \textbf{Unknown problem characteristics}: QQN's broad statistical dominance and graceful degradation make it the safest default choice
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Use specialized alternatives only when}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Stochastic optimization}: Adam-WeightDecay for mini-batch neural network training where QQN's deterministic line search is impractical
\item
  \textbf{Extremely large scale}: When memory constraints prohibit storing L-BFGS history (though QQN degrades gracefully to gradient descent)
\item
  \textbf{Real-time constraints}: When function evaluation cost dominates and approximate solutions suffice
\item
  \textbf{Domain-specific requirements}: When problem structure demands specialized methods (e.g., constrained optimization, online learning)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Practical Implementation Strategy}: Start with QQN-StrongWolfe as the default optimizer. If computational budget is extremely limited, consider QQN-Bisection variants for their efficiency. Only switch to specialized methods if QQN variants demonstrably fail on your specific problem class or if domain constraints require it.

\hypertarget{future-directions}{%
\subsection{Future Directions}\label{future-directions}}

The quadratic interpolation approach of QQN could be extended in various ways:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \textbf{Gradient Scaling (Î³ parameter)}: In deep learning contexts where gradients are often small, introducing an adaptive gradient scaling factor could improve convergence speed without sacrificing robustness.
\item
  \textbf{Momentum Integration}: Incorporating momentum terms into the quadratic path construction to accelerate convergence on problems with consistent gradient directions.
\item
  \textbf{PSO-Like QQN}: Using a global population optimum to guide the quadratic path, similar to particle swarm optimization.
\item
  \textbf{Constrained Optimization}: Extending QQN to handle constraints through trust region-based projective geometry.
\item
  \textbf{Stochastic Extensions}: Adapting QQN for stochastic optimization problems, particularly by optimizing the one-dimensional search under noise.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

We have presented the Quadratic-Quasi-Newton (QQN) algorithm and a comprehensive benchmarking methodology for fair optimization algorithm comparison. Our contributions advance both algorithmic development and empirical evaluation standards in optimization research.

Our evaluation across a comprehensive set of benchmark problems with multiple optimizer variants demonstrates:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Clear Dominance}: QQN variants won the majority of problems, with QQN-Bisection-1 achieving 54W-0L-5T against Trust Region-Conservative. Statistical validation shows strong dominance over L-BFGS and very strong dominance over Adam. Friedman test confirms statistical significance.
\item
  \textbf{Problem-Specific Excellence}: QQN variants achieved 100\% success on convex problems with 50-80\% fewer evaluations than L-BFGS. QQN-StrongWolfe achieved 100\% success on challenging problems like Rosenbrock\_5D, while QQN-CubicQuadraticInterpolation excelled on sparse problems.
\item
  \textbf{Efficiency vs Robustness}: QQN shows superior efficiency with strong success rates across problem types while requiring fewer function evaluations than traditional methods.
\item
  \textbf{Theoretical Foundation}: Rigorous proofs establish global convergence under mild assumptions and local superlinear convergence matching quasi-Newton methods.
\item
  \textbf{Practical Impact}: The results provide clear guidance for practitioners: use QQN-StrongWolfe for general optimization, QQN-Bisection variants for high-dimensional problems, QQN-GoldenSection for multimodal landscapes, and QQN-CubicQuadraticInterpolation for sparse or ill-conditioned problems.
\end{enumerate}

The simplicity of QQN's core insight---that quadratic interpolation provides the natural geometry for combining optimization directions---contrasts with the complexity of recent developments.
Combined with our evaluation methodology, this work establishes new standards for both algorithm development and empirical validation in optimization research.

\textbf{Computational Complexity}: The computational complexity of QQN closely mirrors that of L-BFGS, as the quadratic path construction adds only O(n) operations to the standard L-BFGS iteration.
Wall-clock time comparisons on our benchmark problems would primarily reflect implementation details rather than algorithmic differences.
For problems where function evaluation dominates computation time, QQN's additional overhead is negligible.
The geometric insights provided by counting function evaluations offer more meaningful algorithm characterization than hardware-dependent timing measurements.

The quadratic interpolation principle demonstrates how geometric approaches can provide effective solutions to optimization problems.
We hope this work encourages further exploration of geometric methods in optimization and establishes new standards for rigorous algorithm comparison through our benchmark reporting methodology.
