# The Quest for the Quadratic Grail: A Tale of Sir QQN and the Optimization of Camelot

## The Prophecy Foretold

In the mystical realm of Mathematica, where numbers dance and functions sing, there arose a great need. The Kingdom of Optimization had long been divided between two warring houses: the Swift but Reckless House of Gradient, whose knights charged downhill with unwavering determination but oft found themselves trapped in the valleys of despair, and the Wise but Fragile House of Newton, whose seers could divine the curvature of the land but whose visions sometimes led them astray into the mountains of divergence.

The ancient prophecy spoke of a knight who would unite these houses through a sacred geometry - not through the straight paths of linear combination that many had tried and failed, but through the elegant arc of the parabola, the curve that begins with the courage of descent and bends toward the wisdom of the second order.

## The Birth of Sir QQN

Sir QQN (Quadratic-Quasi-Newton) was born of both houses - his mother from the lineage of Gradient Descent, teaching him to always begin his quest moving downward from where he stood, and his father from the bloodline of L-BFGS, granting him the ability to remember the curvature of paths recently traveled.

Unlike his predecessors who chose either the straight path of gradient or the mystic path of quasi-Newton, Sir QQN discovered the Quadratic Path - a magical trajectory that began tangent to the gradient's direction but curved smoothly toward the quasi-Newton's destination. This path was described by the sacred formula:

**The Parabolic Incantation**: *d(t) = t(1-t)(-∇f) + t²d_LBFGS*

Where t represented the journey's progress from 0 (the beginning) to 1 (the quasi-Newton's destination) and beyond.

## The Tournament of Algorithms

King Arthur of Optimization called for a grand tournament to determine the greatest optimizer in all the land. Sixty-two challenges were set forth, from the gentle slopes of Convex Valley to the treacherous peaks of Multimodal Mountain, from the deceptive paths of Rosenbrock's Maze to the neural networks of Merlin's Deep Learning Tower.

Twenty-five champions answered the call, five from each of the great houses:
- The House of QQN, led by Sir QQN himself with his variants: Golden-Section, Bisection-the-First, Bisection-the-Second, Strong-Wolfe, and Cubic-Quadratic
- The House of L-BFGS, with their champions: The Aggressive, The Standard, The Conservative, Moré-Thuente, and The Limited
- The House of Trust-Region, bearing shields of different sizes
- The House of Gradient-Descent, including Sir Momentum and Sir Nesterov
- The House of Adam, with Adam-the-Fast leading their modern warriors

## The Trials Begin

Each champion faced every challenge fifty times, for the wise knew that fortune could smile differently on each attempt. The scorekeepers tracked not just success, but the number of steps (function evaluations) each knight required.

### The Sphere of Perfect Convexity

In the first trial, the knights faced the Sphere - a perfectly round valley where all paths led to victory. Sir QQN-Bisection achieved perfect victory, reaching the center in merely 12-16 steps, while the gradient knights wandered for hundreds of steps before finding their way.

### Rosenbrock's Cursed Valley

The most treacherous challenge was Rosenbrock's Valley - a narrow, winding canyon where many knights became lost. Here, Sir QQN-StrongWolfe showed his true mettle, achieving success where almost all others failed completely. In the 5-dimensional version of this maze, he alone found the path 35% of the time, while most knights never escaped at all.

### The Multimodal Mountains

In the peaks and valleys of Styblinski-Tang, where false summits deceived many a knight, Sir QQN-StrongWolfe achieved an astounding 90% success rate, finding the true lowest valley with a depth of -76.2, while others remained trapped in local depressions.

## The Wisdom of the Quadratic Path

The secret of Sir QQN's success lay in three sacred principles:

**The First Principle - The Smooth Arc**: Rather than choosing between paths at each crossroads, follow a smooth parabolic arc that naturally blends both wisdoms.

**The Second Principle - The Simplest Curve**: Among all possible paths satisfying the constraints, choose the one of lowest degree - for simplicity holds power.

**The Third Principle - The Guaranteed Descent**: By beginning tangent to the gradient, the path always starts downward, ensuring progress even when the quasi-Newton direction points astray.

## The Final Tally

When the tournament concluded and the scribes tallied their scrolls, Sir QQN's house had claimed victory in 36 of the 62 challenges - a 58% win rate that none could match. The victories were distributed thus:

- Sir QQN-Bisection-the-First: 8 victories
- Sir QQN-StrongWolfe: 7 victories
- Sir QQN-GoldenSection: 6 victories
- And his other variants claiming the rest

The House of L-BFGS proved most efficient on the simplest challenges, requiring only 15 steps where others needed hundreds. The House of Adam showed unique prowess in Merlin's neural network challenges. But none could match the consistent excellence of the Quadratic Knights.

## The Framework of Fair Contest

Beyond the victories, the tournament established a new code of chivalry for optimization contests:

**The Code of Reproducibility**: All contests must be conducted with fixed seeds of randomness, that any knight might recreate the exact conditions of battle.

**The Code of Statistical Honor**: Victory must be proven not by single combat but by multiple trials, with the sacred tests of Welch and Cohen determining true superiority.

**The Code of Equal Arms**: All knights shall be limited by function evaluations, not iterations, for some take many small steps while others take few large strides.

## The Legacy

And so Sir QQN's method spread throughout the kingdom. Apprentice optimizers learned the parabolic way, discovering that the marriage of gradient and quasi-Newton need not be a choice but a journey along a carefully chosen curve.

The framework of fair tournament became the standard for all future contests, ensuring that no champion could claim false victories through favorable conditions or lucky chance.

Some say that Sir QQN still rides through the optimization landscape, his parabolic banner flying high, ready to aid any who seek the global optimum. And in the great library of Camelot, the scrolls containing his method are freely available to all who would learn the way of the Quadratic Path.

## Epilogue: The Continuing Quest

Though Sir QQN had proven his worth, the quest for perfect optimization continues. New challenges arise - the stochastic dragons of online learning, the constrained labyrinths of feasible regions, the high-dimensional forests where even the bravest knights lose their way.

But the foundation has been laid. The Quadratic Path has shown that sometimes the answer lies not in choosing between two goods, but in finding the elegant curve that unites them. And the Framework of Fair Contest ensures that future champions will prove their worth through rigorous trial, not mere boasting in the mead hall.

Thus ends this tale of optimization, where mathematics meets mythology, and the search for the global minimum becomes a quest worthy of the greatest knights of Camelot.
