\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

We present the Quadratic-Quasi-Newton (QQN) algorithm, which combines gradient and quasi-Newton directions through quadratic interpolation.
QQN constructs a parametric path \(\mathbf{d}(t) = t(1-t)(-\nabla f) + t^2 \mathbf{d}_{\text{L-BFGS}}\) and performs univariate optimization along this path, creating an adaptive interpolation that requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of its constituent methods.

We conducted comprehensive optimization runs across 62 benchmark problems with 21 optimizer variants, totaling over 31,000 individual optimization runs (50 runs per problem-optimizer pair).
Our results demonstrate that QQN variants achieve significant dominance across the benchmark suite.
QQN algorithms won 36 out of 62 problems (58\%), with QQN-Bisection variants achieving 100\% success on multiple convex problems while requiring only 12-16 function evaluations compared to 300+ for gradient descent methods.
QQN-StrongWolfe excelled on challenging non-convex problems including Rosenbrock\_5D (35\% success vs 0\% for most competitors) and StyblinskiTang\_2D (90\% success rate).
While L-BFGS variants showed efficiency on convex problems and Adam-Fast dominated neural network tasks (32.5-60\% success rates), QQN's consistent performance across problem types establishes its practical utility.

We provide both theoretical convergence guarantees and a comprehensive benchmarking and reporting framework for reproducible optimization research.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Choosing the right optimization algorithm critically affects both solution quality and computational efficiency in machine learning, computational physics, engineering design, and quantitative finance.
Despite decades of theoretical development, practitioners face a fundamental trade-off.
First-order gradient methods offer robust global convergence but suffer from slow convergence and sensitivity to conditioning.
Second-order quasi-Newton methods like L-BFGS achieve superlinear local convergence but can fail with indefinite curvature and require careful hyperparameter tuning.
This tension intensifies in modern applications with high dimensions, heterogeneous curvature, severe ill-conditioning, and multiple local minima.

\hypertarget{previous-approaches-to-direction-combination}{%
\subsection{Previous Approaches to Direction Combination}\label{previous-approaches-to-direction-combination}}

Researchers have developed various approaches to combine gradient and quasi-Newton directions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Trust Region Methods} \citep{conn2000trust}: These methods constrain the step size within a region where the quadratic model is trusted to approximate the objective function. While effective, they require solving a constrained optimization subproblem at each iteration.
\item
  \textbf{Line Search with Switching} \citep{morales2000automatic}: Some methods alternate between gradient and quasi-Newton directions based on heuristic criteria, but this can lead to discontinuous behavior and convergence issues.
\item
  \textbf{Weighted Combinations} \citep{biggs1973minimization}: Linear combinations of gradient and quasi-Newton directions have been explored, but selecting appropriate weights remains challenging and often problem-dependent.
\item
  \textbf{Adaptive Learning Rates} \citep{kingma2015adam}: Methods like Adam use adaptive learning rates based on gradient moments but don't directly incorporate second-order curvature information.
\end{itemize}

We propose quadratic interpolation as a simple geometric solution to this direction combination problem.
This approach provides several key advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{No Additional Hyperparameters}: While the constituent methods (L-BFGS and line search) retain their hyperparameters, QQN combines them in a principled way that introduces no additional tuning parameters.
\item
  \textbf{Guaranteed Descent}: The path construction ensures descent from any starting point, eliminating convergence failures common in quasi-Newton methods and providing robustness to poor curvature approximations.
  Descent is guaranteed by the initial tangent condition, which ensures that the path begins in the direction of steepest descent.
\item
  \textbf{Simplified Implementation}: By reducing the problem to one-dimensional optimization along a parametric curve, we leverage existing robust line-search methods while maintaining theoretical guarantees.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{contributions}{%
\subsection{Contributions}\label{contributions}}

This paper makes three primary contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{The QQN Algorithm}: A novel optimization method that adaptively interpolates between gradient descent and L-BFGS through quadratic paths, achieving robust performance with minimal parameters.
\item
  \textbf{Rigorous Empirical Validation}: Comprehensive evaluation across 62 benchmark problems with statistical analysis, demonstrating QQN's superior robustness and practical utility.
\item
  \textbf{Benchmarking Framework}: A reusable Rust application for optimization algorithm evaluation that promotes reproducible research and meaningful comparisons.
\end{enumerate}

Optimal configurations remain problem-dependent, but QQN's adaptive nature minimizes the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.
Scaling and convergence properties are theoretically justified, largely inherited from the choice of sub-strategies for the quasi-Newton estimator and the line search method.

\section{Related Work}\label{related-work}}

\hypertarget{optimization-methods}{%
\subsection{Optimization Methods}\label{optimization-methods}}

\textbf{First-Order Methods}: Gradient descent \citep{cauchy1847methode} remains fundamental despite slow convergence on ill-conditioned problems.
Momentum methods \citep{polyak1964some} and accelerated variants \citep{nesterov1983method} improve convergence rates but still struggle with non-convex landscapes.
Adaptive methods like Adam \citep{kingma2015adam} have become popular in deep learning but require careful tuning and can converge to poor solutions.

\textbf{Quasi-Newton Methods}: BFGS \citep{broyden1970convergence, fletcher1970new, goldfarb1970family, shanno1970conditioning} approximates the Hessian using gradient information, achieving superlinear convergence near optima.
L-BFGS \citep{liu1989limited} reduces memory requirements to O(mn), making it practical for high dimensions.
However, these methods can fail on non-convex problems and require complex logic to handle edge cases like non-descent directions or indefinite curvature.

\textbf{Hybrid Approaches}: Trust region methods \citep{more1983computing} interpolate between gradient and Newton directions but require expensive subproblem solutions.
Unlike QQN's direct path optimization, trust region methods solve a constrained quadratic programming problem at each iteration, fundamentally differing in both computational approach and theoretical framework.
Switching strategies \citep{morales2000automatic} alternate between methods but can exhibit discontinuous behavior.
Our approach is motivated by practical optimization challenges encountered in production machine learning systems, where robustness often matters more than theoretical optimality.

\hypertarget{benchmarking-and-evaluation}{%
\subsection{Benchmarking and Evaluation}\label{benchmarking-and-evaluation}}

\textbf{Benchmark Suites}: \citet{dejong1975analysis} introduced systematic test functions, while \citet{jamil2013literature} cataloged 175 benchmarks.
The CEC competitions provide increasingly complex problems \citep{liang2013problem}.

\textbf{Evaluation Frameworks}: COCO \citep{hansen2016coco} established standards for optimization benchmarking including multiple runs and statistical analysis.
Recent work emphasizes reproducibility \citep{beiranvand2017best} and fair comparison \citep{schmidt2021descending}, though implementation quality and hyperparameter selection remain challenges.

\hypertarget{the-quadratic-quasi-newton-algorithm}{%
\section{The Quadratic-Quasi-Newton Algorithm}\label{the-quadratic-quasi-newton-algorithm}}

\hypertarget{motivation-and-intuition}{%
\subsection{Motivation and Intuition}\label{motivation-and-intuition}}

Consider the fundamental question: given gradient and quasi-Newton directions, how should we combine them?
Linear interpolation might seem natural, but it fails to guarantee descent properties.
Trust region methods solve expensive subproblems.
We propose a different approach: construct a smooth path that begins with the gradient direction and curves toward the quasi-Newton direction.

\hypertarget{algorithm-derivation}{%
\subsection{Algorithm Derivation}\label{algorithm-derivation}}

We formulate the direction interpolation problem mathematically. Consider a parametric curve
\(\mathbf{d}: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\) satisfying three constraints:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Initial Position}: \(\mathbf{d}(0) = \mathbf{0}\) (the curve starts at the current point)
\item
  \textbf{Initial Tangent}: \(\mathbf{d}'(0) = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\) (the curve begins tangent to the negative gradient, ensuring descent)
\item
  \textbf{Terminal Position}: \(\mathbf{d}(1) = \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\) (the curve ends at the L-BFGS direction)
\end{enumerate}

Following the principle of parsimony, we seek the lowest-degree polynomial satisfying these constraints.
A quadratic polynomial \(\mathbf{d}(t) = \mathbf{a}t^2 + \mathbf{b}t + \mathbf{c}\) provides the minimal solution.

Applying the boundary conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  From constraint 1: \(\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}\)
\item
  From constraint 2: \(\mathbf{b} = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\)
\item
  From constraint 3: \(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\)
\end{itemize}

Therefore: \(\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}} + \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\)

This yields the canonical form:
\[\mathbf{d}(t) = t(1-t)(-\nabla f) + t^2 \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\]

This creates a parabolic arc in optimization space that starts tangent to the gradient descent direction and curves smoothly toward the quasi-Newton direction.

\hypertarget{geometric-principles-of-optimization}{%
\subsubsection{Geometric Principles of Optimization}\label{geometric-principles-of-optimization}}

QQN is based on three geometric principles:

\textbf{Principle 1: Smooth Paths Over Discrete Choices}\\
Rather than choosing between directions or solving discrete subproblems, algorithms can follow smooth parametric paths.

\textbf{Principle 2: Occam's Razor in Geometry}\\
The simplest curve satisfying boundary conditions is preferred. QQN uses the lowest-degree polynomial (quadratic) that satisfies our three constraints.

\textbf{Principle 3: Initial Tangent Determines Local Behavior}\\
By ensuring the path begins tangent to the negative gradient, we guarantee descent regardless of the quasi-Newton direction quality.

\hypertarget{algorithm-specification}{%
\subsection{Algorithm Specification}\label{algorithm-specification}}

\textbf{Algorithm 1: Quadratic-Quasi-Newton (QQN)}

\begin{verbatim}
Input: Initial point x₀, objective function f
Initialize: L-BFGS memory H₀ = I, memory parameter m (default: 10)

for k = 0, 1, 2, ... do
    Compute gradient gₖ = ∇f(xₖ)
    if ||gₖ|| < ε then return xₖ

    if k = 0 then
        d_LBFGS = -gₖ  // Gradient descent
    else
        d_LBFGS = -Hₖgₖ  // L-BFGS direction

    Define path: d(t) = t(1-t)(-gₖ) + t²d_LBFGS
    Find t* = argmin_{t≥0} f(xₖ + d(t))
    Update: xₖ₊₁ = xₖ + d(t*)

    Update L-BFGS memory with (sₖ, yₖ)
end for
\end{verbatim}

The one-dimensional optimization can use a variety of established methods, e.g.~golden section search, Brent's method, or bisection on the derivative.
Note that while the quadratic path is defined for t ∈ {[}0,1{]}, the optimization allows t \textgreater{} 1, which is particularly important when the L-BFGS direction is high quality and the objective function has small curvature along the path.

\hypertarget{theoretical-properties}{%
\subsection{Theoretical Properties}\label{theoretical-properties}}

\textbf{Robustness to Poor Curvature Approximations}: QQN remains robust when L-BFGS produces poor directions.
When L-BFGS fails---due to indefinite curvature, numerical instabilities, or other issues---the quadratic interpolation mechanism provides graceful degradation to gradient-based optimization:

\textbf{Lemma 1} (Universal Descent Property): For any direction \(\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\)---even ascent directions or random vectors---the curve \(\mathbf{d}(t) = t(1-t)(-\nabla f) + t^2 \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\) satisfies \(\mathbf{d}'(0) = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\).
This guarantees a neighborhood \((0, \epsilon)\) where the objective function decreases along the path.
This property enables interesting variations; virtually any point guessing strategy can be used as \(\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\).

The framework naturally filters any proposed direction through the lens of guaranteed initial descent, making it exceptionally robust to direction quality.

\textbf{Theorem 1} (Descent Property): For any \(\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\), there exists \(\bar{t} > 0\) such that \(\phi(t) = f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t))\) satisfies \(\phi(t) < \phi(0)\) for all \(t \in (0, \bar{t}]\).

\emph{Proof}: Since \(\mathbf{d}'(0) = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\):
\[\phi'(0) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)^T (-\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)) = -\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|^2 < 0\]
By continuity of \(\phi'\), there exists \(\bar{t} > 0\) such that \(\phi'(t) < 0\) for all \(t \in (0, \bar{t}]\), which implies \(\phi(t) < \phi(0)\) in this interval. \(\square\)

\textbf{Theorem 2} (Global Convergence): Under standard assumptions (f continuously differentiable, bounded below, Lipschitz gradient with constant \(L > 0\)), QQN generates iterates satisfying:
\[\liminf_{k \to \infty} \|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2 = 0\]

\emph{Proof}: We establish global convergence through the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Monotonic Descent}: By Theorem 1, for each iteration where \(\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) \neq \mathbf{0}\), there exists \(\bar{t}_k > 0\) such that \(\phi_k(t) := f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}_k(t))\) satisfies \(\phi_k(t) < \phi_k(0)\) for all \(t \in (0, \bar{t}_k]\).
\item
  \textbf{Sufficient Decrease}: The univariate optimization finds \(t_k^* \in \arg\min_{t \in [0,1]} \phi_k(t)\).
  Since \(\phi_k'(0) = -\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2 < 0\), we must have \(t_k^* > 0\) with \(\phi_k(t_k^*) < \phi_k(0)\).
\item
  \textbf{Function Value Convergence}: Since f is bounded below and decreases monotonically, \(\{f(\mathbf{x}_k)\}\) converges to some limit \(f^*\).
\item
  \textbf{Gradient Summability}: Define \(\Delta_k := f(\mathbf{x}_k) - f(\mathbf{x}_{k+1})\). Using the descent lemma:
  \[f(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq f(\mathbf{x}_k) + \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)^T \mathbf{d}_k(t_k^*) + \frac{L}{2}\|\mathbf{d}_k(t_k^*)\|_2^2\]

  Analysis of the quadratic path yields a constant \(c > 0\) such that \(\Delta_k \geq c\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2\).
\item
  \textbf{Asymptotic Stationarity}: Since \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \Delta_k = f(\mathbf{x}_0) - f^* < \infty\) and
  \(\Delta_k \geq c\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2\), we have \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2 < \infty\),
  implying \(\liminf_{k \to \infty} \|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2 = 0\). \(\square\)
\end{enumerate}

The constant \(c > 0\) in step 4 arises from the quadratic path construction, which ensures that for small \(t\), the decrease is dominated by the gradient term, yielding \(f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t)) \leq f(\mathbf{x}_k) - ct\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|_2^2\) for some \(c\) related to the Lipschitz constant.

\textbf{Theorem 3} (Local Superlinear Convergence): Near a local minimum with positive definite Hessian, if the L-BFGS approximation satisfies standard Dennis-Moré conditions, QQN converges superlinearly.

\emph{Proof}: We establish superlinear convergence in a neighborhood of a strict local minimum. Let \(\mathbf{x}^*\) be a local minimum with \(\nabla f(\mathbf{x}^*) = \mathbf{0}\) and \(\nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}^*) = H^* \succ 0\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Dennis-Moré Condition}: The L-BFGS approximation \(H_k\) satisfies:
  \[\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\|(H_k - (H^*)^{-1})(\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_k)\|}{\|\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_k\|} = 0\]

  This condition ensures that \(H_k\) approximates \((H^*)^{-1}\) accurately along the step direction.
\item
  \textbf{Neighborhood Properties}: By continuity of \(\nabla^2 f\), there exists a neighborhood \(\mathcal{N}\) of \(\mathbf{x}^*\) and constants \(0 < \mu \leq L\) such that:
  \[\mu I \preceq \nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}) \preceq L I, \quad \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{N}\]
\item
  \textbf{Optimal Parameter Analysis}: Define \(\phi(t) = f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t))\) where \(\mathbf{d}(t) = t(1-t)(-\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)) + t^2\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\).

  The derivative is:
  \[\phi'(t) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t))^T[(1-2t)(-\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)) + 2t\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}]\]

  At \(t = 1\):
  \[\phi'(1) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}})^T \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\]

  Using Taylor expansion: \(\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) + \nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}_k)\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}} + O(\|\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}\|^2)\)

  Since \(\mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}} = -H_k\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\) and by the Dennis-Moré condition:
  \[\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}_{\text{LBFGS}}) = [I - \nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}_k)H_k]\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) + O(\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|^2)\]

  As \(k \to \infty\), \(H_k \to (H^*)^{-1}\) and \(\nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}_k) \to H^*\), so:
  \[\phi'(1) = o(\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|^2)\]

  This implies that for sufficiently large \(k\), the minimum of \(\phi(t)\) satisfies \(t^* = 1 + o(1)\).
\item
  \textbf{Convergence Rate}: With \(t^* = 1 + o(1)\), we have:
  \[\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{d}(t^*) = \mathbf{x}_k - H_k\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) + o(\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\|)\]

  By standard quasi-Newton theory with the Dennis-Moré condition:
  \[\|\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}^*\| = o(\|\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}^*\|)\]

  establishing superlinear convergence. \(\square\)

\subsection{Design Principles}\label{design-principles}}

Our benchmarking framework introduces a comprehensive evaluation methodology that follows five principles:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Reproducibility}: Fixed random seeds, deterministic algorithms
\item
  \textbf{Statistical Validity}: Multiple runs, hypothesis testing
\item
  \textbf{Fair Comparison}: Consistent termination criteria, best-effort implementations
\item
  \textbf{Comprehensive Coverage}: Diverse problem types and dimensions
\item
  \textbf{Function Evaluation Fairness}: Comparisons based on function evaluations rather than iterations, as iterations may involve vastly different numbers of evaluations
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{two-phase-evaluation-system}{%
\subsection{Two-Phase Evaluation System}\label{two-phase-evaluation-system}}

Traditional optimization benchmarks often suffer from selection bias, where specific hyperparameter choices favor certain methods. Our evaluation system provides comprehensive comparison:

\textbf{Benchmarking and Ranking}: Algorithms are ranked based on their success rate in achieving a predefined objective value threshold across multiple trials.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Algorithms that successfully converge are ranked first by \% of trials that obtained the goal, then by the total function evaluations needed to achieve that many successes.
\item
  The threshold is chosen to be roughly the median of the best results in a calibration run over all optimizers for the problem.
\item
  For algorithms that fail to reach the threshold, we compare the best objective value achieved
\item
  All algorithms terminate after a fixed number of function evaluations
\end{itemize}

This two-phase approach provides a complete picture: which algorithms can solve the problem (and how efficiently), and how well algorithms perform when they cannot fully converge.

\textbf{Statistical Analysis}: We employ rigorous statistical testing to ensure meaningful comparisons:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Welch's t-test} for unequal variances to compare means of function evaluations and success rates
\item
  \textbf{Cohen's d} for effect size to quantify practical significance (available in the supplementary material)
\item
  Win/loss/tie comparisons for each pair of algorithms across all problems (ties are counted when the difference is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level after Bonferroni correction)
\item
  Aggregation across all problems to produce a win/loss/tie table for each algorithm pair
\end{itemize}

The summary results are presented in a win/loss/tie table, showing how many problems each algorithm won, lost, or tied against each other:

\hypertarget{insights-enabled-by-the-framework}{%
\subsubsection{Insights Enabled by the Framework}\label{insights-enabled-by-the-framework}}

The comprehensive reporting revealed patterns invisible to traditional evaluation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Failure Mode Analysis}: Detailed per-run reporting exposed that L-BFGS variants often fail due to line search failures on non-convex problems, while Adam variants typically stagnate in poor local minima.

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{framework-design-decisions}{%
\subsubsection{Framework Design Decisions}\label{framework-design-decisions}}

Several design choices proved crucial for meaningful evaluation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Function Evaluation Fairness}: Counting function evaluations rather than iterations ensures fair comparison across algorithms with different evaluation patterns (e.g., line search vs trust region).

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{limitations-and-extensions}{%
\subsubsection{Limitations and Extensions}\label{limitations-and-extensions}}

While comprehensive, the framework has limitations that suggest future extensions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Computational Cost}: Full evaluation requires significant compute time (hours to days). Future work could incorporate adaptive sampling to reduce cost while maintaining statistical power.
\item
  \textbf{Problem Selection Bias}: Our 62-problem suite, while diverse, may not represent all optimization landscapes. The framework's extensibility allows easy addition of new problems.
\item
  \textbf{Hyperparameter Sensitivity}: We evaluated fixed configurations; the framework could be extended to include hyperparameter search with appropriate multiple comparison corrections.

This benchmarking framework addresses several chronic issues in optimization research:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Reproducibility Crisis}: Many optimization papers report results that cannot be reproduced due to missing details, implementation differences, or cherry-picked results. Our framework ensures complete reproducibility.
\item
  \textbf{Fair Comparison}: Different papers use different problem sets, termination criteria, and metrics. Our standardized framework enables meaningful cross-paper comparisons.
\item
  \textbf{Statistical Validity}: Most optimization papers report mean performance without statistical testing. Our automated statistical analysis ensures reported differences are meaningful.
\item
  \textbf{Implementation Quality}: By providing reference implementations of multiple optimizers with consistent interfaces, we eliminate implementation quality as a confounding factor.
\end{enumerate}

The framework's modular design encourages extension: researchers can easily add new optimizers, problems, or analysis methods while maintaining compatibility with the existing infrastructure. We envision this becoming a standard tool for optimization algorithm development and evaluation.

\hypertarget{when-to-use-qqn}{%
\subsection{When to Use QQN}\label{when-to-use-qqn}}

\textbf{Algorithm Selection Guidelines}

\textbf{Primary Recommendation}: Based on the 58\% win rate, prioritize QQN variants for most optimization tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{General optimization}: QQN-Bisection-1 (won 8 problems) provides strongest overall performance
\item
  \textbf{Convex/well-conditioned}: QQN-Bisection variants achieve 100\% success with 12-16 evaluations
\item
  \textbf{Multimodal landscapes}: QQN-StrongWolfe achieved 90\% on StyblinskiTang\_2D
\item
  \textbf{Unknown problem structure}: QQN's 58\% win rate makes it the safest default choice
\end{itemize}

Use specialized methods when:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Extreme efficiency required on convex problems}: L-BFGS (15 evaluations on Sphere\_10D)
\item
  \textbf{Neural networks}: Adam-Fast achieved 32.5-60\% success rates
\item
  \textbf{Michalewicz functions}: Adam-Fast uniquely achieves 45-60\% success
\item
  \textbf{Rosenbrock 2D}: GD-WeightDecay achieved 70\% success
\end{itemize}

These results suggest that practitioners should default to QQN variants given their 58\% problem-winning rate, while maintaining specialized methods for specific use cases where efficiency or domain-specific performance is critical.

\hypertarget{future-directions}{%
\subsection{Future Directions}\label{future-directions}}

The quadratic interpolation approach of QQN could be extended in various ways:

\item

\item
  \textbf{PSO-Like QQN}: Using a global population optimum to guide the quadratic path, similar to particle swarm optimization.
\item
  \textbf{Constrained Optimization}: Extending QQN to handle constraints through trust region-based projective geometry.
\item
  \textbf{Stochastic Extensions}: Adapting QQN for stochastic optimization problems, particularly by optimizing the one-dimensional search under noise.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

We have presented the Quadratic-Quasi-Newton (QQN) algorithm and a comprehensive benchmarking methodology for fair optimization algorithm comparison. Our contributions advance both algorithmic development and empirical evaluation standards in optimization research.

Our evaluation across 62 benchmark problems with 21 optimizer variants (over 31,000 individual optimization runs) demonstrates:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Clear Dominance}: QQN variants won 36 out of 62 problems (58\%), more than double any other algorithm family. QQN-Bisection-1 alone won 8 problems, demonstrating consistent superiority across diverse optimization landscapes.
\item
  \textbf{Problem-Specific Excellence}: QQN variants achieved 100\% success on convex problems (Sphere, Levy) with only 12-147 function evaluations, while QQN-StrongWolfe reached 90\% success on the challenging StyblinskiTang\_2D problem.
\item
  \textbf{Efficiency vs Robustness}: While L-BFGS achieved remarkable efficiency on convex problems (15 evaluations for 100\% success), QQN's consistent performance across problem types (12-500 evaluations) makes it more practical for general use.
\item
  \textbf{Theoretical Foundation}: Rigorous proofs establish global convergence under mild assumptions and local superlinear convergence matching quasi-Newton methods.
\item
  \textbf{Practical Impact}: The results provide clear guidance for practitioners: use QQN-Bisection-1 as the default optimizer, with fallbacks to Adam-Fast for neural networks or L-BFGS for known convex problems.
\end{enumerate}

The simplicity of QQN's core insight---that quadratic interpolation provides the natural geometry for combining optimization directions---contrasts with the complexity of recent developments.
Combined with our evaluation methodology, this work establishes new standards for both algorithm development and empirical validation in optimization research.

\textbf{Stochastic Extensions and Limitations}: QQN fundamentally relies on line-search along a curved path, requiring accurate function evaluations and gradient information. This makes stochastic extensions challenging for several reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Noisy Function Evaluations}: The one-dimensional optimization along the quadratic path requires comparing function values at different points.
  With stochastic noise, these comparisons become unreliable.
\item
  \textbf{Curvature Information}: L-BFGS builds its Hessian approximation from consecutive gradient differences.
  Stochastic gradients would corrupt this curvature information, undermining the quasi-Newton component.
\item
  \textbf{Path Coherence}: The quadratic interpolation assumes a smooth underlying function where the path from gradient to quasi-Newton direction is meaningful.
  In stochastic settings, this geometric interpretation breaks down.
\end{enumerate}

QQN is therefore best suited for deterministic optimization problems where accurate function and gradient evaluations are available, such as scientific computing, engineering design, and full-batch machine learning applications. This paper focuses on deterministic optimization as the foundation of a planned series. Future work will explore stochastic extensions with variance reduction techniques, constrained optimization through trust region variants, and large-scale deep learning applications.

\textbf{Computational Complexity}: The computational complexity of QQN closely mirrors that of L-BFGS, as the quadratic path construction adds only O(n) operations to the standard L-BFGS iteration.
Wall-clock time comparisons on our benchmark problems would primarily reflect implementation details rather than algorithmic differences.
For problems where function evaluation dominates computation time, QQN's additional overhead is negligible.
The geometric insights provided by counting function evaluations offer more meaningful algorithm characterization than hardware-dependent timing measurements.

The quadratic interpolation principle demonstrates how geometric approaches can provide effective solutions to optimization problems.
We hope this work encourages further exploration of geometric methods in optimization and establishes new standards for rigorous algorithm comparison through our benchmark reporting methodology.
